# üß† MinesweeperAI: Plug and Play Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to MinesweeperAI, an interactive Python-based Minesweeper game with a powerful AI solver designed to make learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) engaging and accessible.

## üéì About the Project

DSA is one of the most challenging subjects in computer science, often seen as dry and abstract. This project transforms these concepts into something visual and interactive, allowing you to see DSA in action! MinesweeperAI isn't just a game‚Äîit's a learning tool where you can observe different search algorithms and data structures tackling the classic Minesweeper puzzle in real-time. Whether you're a student or an educator, this project provides a practical and intuitive way to understand and teach DSA.

### üí° Features

- Interactive DSA Learning: See how different algorithms and data structures operate in a real-world scenario.
- Customisable AI Strategies: Plug and play with different configurations to explore their impacts.
- Visual and Intuitive Interface: A clean and modern UI that makes understanding complex concepts more accessible.

## üéÆ How to Use MinesweeperAI

- Choose Your Algorithm: You can select from various search algorithms directly from the game menu. You can also experiment with different data structures to see how they influence the AI's performance.
- Set Your Board: Use the options menu to customise the board size, number of mines, and speed and select your starting position for fairer comparisons.
- Watch and Learn: Observe the AI as it solves the puzzle, displaying real-time statistics and decision-making processes.


## üöÄ Current Version: v1.20
### ‚ú® What's New in v1.20

- Merged Game and Performance Stats: Combined the Game Stats and Performance Stats into a single, streamlined panel for a cleaner interface.
- Dynamic Scaling: Text, flags, and mines now scale dynamically with cell size, ensuring clarity on any board size.
- Improved Start Cell Logic: Enhanced the logic for user-selected starting positions for more consistent and accurate placement.
- Strategic Random Cell Selection: Reworked AI logic to better navigate around potential mine "walls," improving its ability to solve the board.
